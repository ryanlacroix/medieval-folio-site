            <p>
                In the European tradition, medieval manuscripts are hand-made objects, such as codices and scrolls,
                completed before the end of the Middle Ages (roughly the fifth - sixteenth century CE). These objects are
                often
                illuminated (hand-painted in metallic paints of gold and silver) and feature art within their margins as
                decorations. Others are more simple, using only black (or dark brown) and red inks for the text and
                structural elements with little or no decoration.
                Medieval manuscripts had less diversity of contents than the modern literary repertoire. Charters,
                religious
                texts, and philosophical works (Plato and Aristotle being popular topics) were among the most common
                genres
                of medieval manuscripts. Of the religious manuscripts, the most common were within the Christian
                tradition
                but Judaic and Islamic codices were also circulated in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because each medieval manuscript is handmade and handwritten, each is distinct in both material and
                structure, as well as content. Digitizing often means that two dimensional images are generated as a
                means
                to reproduce them. Unfortunately, this means there are inevitably aspects of the physical object that
                are
                missing in the digital format (think spatial evidence, touch, and even sound). However, there are many reasons why reproducing
                manuscripts digitally is truer to their original nature than a unitary printed edition. For one, medieval
                liturgical
                manuscripts are naturally hypertextual and are meant to be contextualised in a larger body of works that
                would have been fixed knowledge to the monastic scholar. In other words, culturally ingrained knowledge
                of
                the liturgy formed many layers of understanding in the medieval mind that can be reproduced best in a
                non-linear, hypertext format. This way, information can be accessed ad hoc and can be as general or
                thorough
                as the need demands.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Although it is clear that our understanding of medieval artefacts can be deepened by the digital format,
                it
                is also important to consider
                how the digital turn changes how people interact with manuscripts. Importantly, I have found that the
                tools
                I have used to produce the interactive transcription (from digital camera to Transkribus) has shaped the
                outcome of the digitization and therefore influences how the end user will perceive and interact with
                the
                manuscript. Notably, because I did not have access to a large format scanner, a digital camera was used
                to
                produce the images hosted on the website. This has created consistency issues in both lighting and
                sizing.
                Still, many humanists encourage the digital turn. In fact, a major treatise on the topic, <em>Meeting
                    the
                    Medieval in a Digital World,</em> published in 2018, compels scholars to see themselves as not only
                medievalists, humanists, etc. but as digital humanists also. The work outlines exciting and novel ways
                to
                interact with manuscripts using digital tools and the final chapter even acts as a roadmap for scholars
                hoping to bridge the gap between their own disciplines and the digital realm.<a href="#_ftn2"

            <h2 style="padding-top: 20px;">What is the Carleton Compound manuscript?</h2>
            <hr />
            <br />
            <p>
                The manuscript that is digitally
                reproduced here is <em>Ottawa, Carleton University Library, Archives and Research Collection MS. 1</em>
                (hereby referred to as the Carleton Antiphonary). Like all medieval manuscripts, it is distinct in both material
                and
                structure, as well as content. It is a compound manuscript i.e. containing separate manuscripts
                that are bound together in a modern binding. The primary manuscript (Part A -
                f.1r
                - 61v) is consistent with manuscripts of late-fifteenth/early sixteenth century Iberian provenience and the
                secondary
                manuscript (Part B - f.62r -64v) corresponds with fourteenth century Gothic Quadrata manuscripts copied in
                southern
                Europe. The isolated final leaf (Final Leaf - f.65r - 65v) is likely a later addition to the composite manuscript and
                is
                compatible with southern European rotunda manuscripts.
            </p>
            <p>Each of the manuscripts are incomplete texts taken from Christian liturgical manuscripts which feature
                plainchant.
                The first manuscript (Part A), includes a tonary followed by sections from
                the
                canonical hours (or liturgy of the hours): the office of the dead and various feasts days. However, the
                second manuscript (part B) is a hymnal, demonstrating a clear distinction from part A.
            </p>
            <p>There are no accession records about the entry of the manuscript into 
                <a href="https://asc.library.carleton.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carleton's Archive and Research
                    Collection (ARC)</a>, but a donation plate added to the interior binding suggests that the manuscript may
                have
                been donated to St. Patrick's College before its dissolution in 1973 at which time the library was
                amalgamated with Carleton's. There are no records to indicate its provenience prior to this time, so
                we must depend on physical evidence to indicate the provenience for the manuscript.
            </p>
            <p>Carleton's ARC has been collecting manuscript fragments for teaching purposes. ARC also has a second
                liturgical chant manuscript in its holdings (Ms.2) as well as eleven medieval materials including leaves
                from books of hours and bibles, and two English charter documents (<em>see</em>
                <a href="https://manuscriptsottawa.wordpress.com/catalogue/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Manuscripts Ottawa</a>, a
                catalogue I made for my bachelor's thesis project, for more details on ARC's holdings).

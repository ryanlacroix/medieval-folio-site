        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            In the European tradition, medieval manuscripts are hand-made objects, such as codices and scrolls,
            completed before the end of the Middle Ages (roughly fifth - sixteenth century CE). These objects are often
            illuminated (hand-painted in metallic paints of gold and silver) and feature art within their margins as
            decorations. Others are more simple, using only black (or dark brown) and red inks for the text and
            structure with little or no decoration.
            Medieval manuscripts had less diversity of contents than the modern literary repertoire. Charters, religious
            texts, and philosophical works (Plato and Aristotle being popular topics) were among the most common genres
            of medieval manuscripts. Of the religious manuscripts, the most common were within the Christian tradition
            but Judaic and Islamic codices were also circulated in Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because each medieval manuscript is handmade and handwritten, each is distinct in both material and
            structure, as well as content. Digitizing often means that two dimensional images are generated as a means
            to reproduce them. Unfortunately, this means there are inevitably aspects of the physical object that are
            missing in the digital format (think spatial evidence, touch, and even sound). However, reproducing
            manuscripts digitally is truer to their original nature than a unitary printed edition. Medieval liturgical
            manuscripts are naturally hypertextual and are meant to be contextualised in a larger body of works that
            would have been fixed knowledge to the monastic scholar. In other words, culturally ingrained knowledge of
            the liturgy formed many layers of understanding in the medieval mind that can be reproduced best in a
            non-linear, hypertext format. This way, information can be accessed ad hoc and can be as general or thorough
            as the need demands.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Although it is clear that our understanding of medieval artefacts can be deepened by the digital format, it
            is also important to consider
            how the digital turn changes how people interact with manuscripts. Importantly, I have found that the tools
            I have used to produce the interactive transcription (from digital camera to Transkribus) has shaped the
            outcome of the digitization and therefore influences how the end user will perceive and interact with the
            manuscript. Notably, because I did not have access to a large format scanner, a digital camera was used to
            produce the images hosted on the website. This has created consistency issues in both lighting and sizing.
            Still, many humanists encourage the digital turn. In fact, a major treatise on the topic, <em>Meeting the
                Medieval in a Digital World,</em> published in 2018, compels scholars to see themselves as not only
            medievalists, humanists, etc. but as digital humanities also. The work outlines exciting and novel ways to
            interact with manuscripts using digital tools and the final chapter even acts as a roadmap for scholars
            hoping to bridge the gap between their own disciplines and the digital realm.<a href="#_ftn2"

        <h2>What is the Carleton Compound manuscript?</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            The manuscript that is digitally
            reproduced here is <em>Ottawa, Carleton University Library, Archives and Research Collection MS. 1</em>
            (referred to as the Carleton Antiphonary). Like all medieval manuscripts it is distinct in both material and
            structure, as well as content. It is a compound manuscript i.e. containing two once separate manuscripts
            that are bound together in a modern binding and features a distinct final leaf. The primary manuscript (f.1r
            - 61v) is consistent with an Iberian late-fifteenth/early sixteenth century provenience and the secondary
            manuscript (f.62r -64v) corresponds with fourteenth century Gothic Quadrata manuscripts copied in southern
            Europe. The isolated final leaf (f.65r - 65v) is likely a later addition to the composite manuscript and is
            compatible with southern European rotunda manuscripts.
        </p>
        <p>Both manuscripts are incomplete texts taken from Christian liturgical manuscripts which features plainchant.
            The first manuscript, which will be referred to as part A, includes a tonary, followed by sections from the
            canonical hours (or liturgy of the hours): the office of the dead and various feasts days. However, the
            second manuscript (part B) is a hymnal, demonstrating a clear distinction from part A.
        </p>
        <p>There are no accession records about the entry of the manuscript into Carleton's Archive and Research
            Collection (ARC), but a donation plate added to the interior binding suggests that the manuscript may have
            been donated to St. Patrick's College before its dissolution in 1973 at which time the library was
            amalgamated with Carleton's. There are no records to indicate its provenience prior to this time, so
            we must depend on physical evidence to indicate the provenience for the manuscript.
        </p>
        <p>Carleton's ARC has been collecting manuscript fragments for teaching purposes. ARC also has a second
            liturgical chant manuscript in its holdings (Ms.2) as well as eleven medieval materials including leaves
            from books of hours and bibles, and two English charter documents (<em>see</em> 
            <a href="https://manuscriptsottawa.wordpress.com/catalogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manuscripts Ottawa</a>, a
            catalogue I made during my undergrad, for more details on ARC's holdings).

		<h3>How to read this edition</h3>
		<p> 
			This transcription of the manuscript&rsquo;s text is a visual reproduction, and a diplomatic edition. In this
			digital edition, I have placed the images of each manuscript page on the left hand side. On the right side,
			I offer a transcription which does not regularize or modernize the Latin, but rather retains scribal
			mistakes, abbreviated characters, and punctuation as it exists in the manuscript. Given the unique nature of
			liturgical manuscripts, I did not seek to establish a comparative critical edition&mdash;i.e. The product of
			studying multiple manuscripts to construct a final version with the cumulative information from each codex.
			Rather, my edition, as it lives in the digital realm, seeks to let the user guide their interaction with the
			text. They can consult the original manuscript (in digitized images), they can consult a direct
			transcription of the text alongside the images, they can also read the alternate text with abbreviations
			unpacked and punctuation regularized. Given the potential for non-linear usage, I consider my edition a
			hypertext edition, because the linked presentation of information achieves through the digital format
			something unlike traditional print texts.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Privileging transcription over finished edition</h5>
		<p>
			The benefit of a transcription over a finished edition is that researchers can easily study the
			palaeographical and codicological aspects of this manuscript through the non-linear use I have described
			above. This decision was made because Carleton Antiphonary, like most liturgical manuscripts, is unique in
			its physical composition not only by the nature of handmade work but also because so many liturgical
			manuscripts were distinct products of their time, location, and monastic tradition. The decision to make the
			transcription and edition digital was in large part a question of access, especially because Carleton
			University, as a Canadian institution, must rely heavily on digital content for the study of European
			manuscripts.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Digital Format</h5>
		<p>
			Because of the digital format, the text can be shown in numerous ways without compromising user experience,
			i.e. the reader does not need to constantly refer to the index and appendices at the back of a paper copy to
			make sense of the text. As you will see, in order to unpack an abbreviation or symbol as presented in the
			manuscript in the transcription, the user must simply hover over the word or symbol to have it unpacked
			(with the exception of common usage symbols, as listed in table 7, below).
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Abbreviations</h5>
		<p>
			The table below outlines the abbreviations used throughout the Carleton Antiphonary and explains which
			Unicode symbols were used to mimic the manuscript&rsquo;s forms. The expansion or modern equivalent are also
			given, with multiple possible expansions where applicable. The rightmost column displays whether the
			abbreviations have been unpacked in the hypertext edition. Note that symbols that replace single letterforms
			(e.g. ꝛ, ꝺ, and Ꝫ) are not unpacked in this transcription but abbreviations with two or more letters are
			unpacked to maintain clarity for the researcher while using this tool.

		<h5>Image files</h5>
		<p>
			The images found on the website were originally produced in TIFF, which were far too large (approximately 5 -
			6 Mi each) even for modern web standards. From a web-friendly point of view, the images had to be cropped
			and resized to allow for quick load times on the website. Although the TIFF files would have provided
			extremely clear images for the scrutiny of minute details of the manuscript that in-depth manuscript study
			often demands, this decision came from a user experience (UX) stand-point to ensure compatibility with the
			widest range of browsers. That being said, the images are still high-quality (362 KB, 685 x 923) and useful
			for study. Furthermore, they are available for download so scholars may quickly and frequently access them.
		</p>
		<p>
			These images were taken with a digital
			camera, (Canon EOS REBEL T5i) with less than ideal lighting, but in future we hope to produce scans of the
			manuscript. Unfortunately, we did not have access to a large enough scanner at the time of this project.
			This presented unique challenges because the orientation, lighting, and dimensions of each image were
			distinct. In other words, each of the 148 original images would have to be manually manipulated. Therefore,
			the batch image processor IrfanView, a freeware (proprietary but free to use) software for Windows users,
			was used to resize the images to a standard size. This allowed the website to display the folios in a
			streamline and consistent fashion, giving the reader a book-like experience despite the vastly different
			sizes and orientation of the original images. As you will see, the result is not perfect, but provides a far
			more attractive product in the final version.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>3.2 Web Edition vs Paper Version</h3>
		<p>
			When I was first introduced to the Carleton Antiphonary in 2016 Carleton University&rsquo;s Archives and
			Research Collections had not yet digitally catalogued any of their medieval materials, nor do they exist in
			the library's catalogue. For researchers, it was as if the manuscript did not exist. This project sought to
			address this problem by creating an online edition for the codex, circumventing the issues with access
			intrinsic to the printed edition. The main issue that was apparent to me was access to the edition. It could
			be written in printed or PDF format and lay hidden in a university&rsquo;s catalogue, where researchers from
			both Carleton and elsewhere may never know of its existence, closing the initial circle that I sought to
			address. But a digital project, connected to a popular public database such as the Cantus Database, would
			have more visibility and would contribute to the mission of bringing this manuscript to light.<sup> <a
					href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></sup>
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Broader Access</h5>
		<p>
			Some of these fundamental issues are that the commentary and glossary are usually separate from the
			transcription, segregated to the end of the paperback, often rendering it cumbersome for reference.
			Furthermore, a printed work must be produced, published, and distributed before it is accessible to
			scholars. Electronic editions, however, change this process &ndash; making editions not a product but a
			process that can be published online while in progress to allow other scholars to make use of the work and
			possibly to contribute to it. In essence, once the work is online and accessible (usually through an
			institution) it is catalogued and therefore referenceable, unlike projects which are left to languish
			gathering dust within the shelves upon shelves of uncatalogued theses.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scholars of medieval liturgy and codicology can know of the manuscript&rsquo;s existence and perhaps reveal
			some of its long-held secrets through this diplomatic edition. Found on this bespoke website created with
			the purpose of showcasing this manuscript in ways suited to its study as both object and text.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Cantus Index</h5>
		<p>
			Cantus is a manuscript database used to reference medieval and early modern Latin ecclesiastical sources. The
			resource was created by the University of Waterloo and is managed collaboratively by Debra Lacoste
			(University of Waterloo) and Jan Kol&aacute;ček (Charles University, Prague). It has nine major databases
			connected to it from across the globe and over 150 sources. Each source is indexed according to its chants
			and connected with any concordant chants from other sources. Each chant has a unique Cantus ID number that
			is used to reference the list of chants in the Cantus Index, a catalogue for the Cantus Database. In the
			Manuscript Reading (Ms spelling) transcription I have identified each segment of the manuscript by the
			appropriate Cantus ID (see Appendices).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> This
			allows researchers to quickly analyse the various parts of the manuscript and find contextual data for that
			particular segment. Cantus provides details such as associated feast days, genre, position in office or
			mass, and a list of the concordances for each chant. Users may further research by perusing the hundreds of
			manuscript holdings digitally uploaded by institutions onto Cantus Database through the identifiers.
			Interconnectivity with scholarly platforms such as Cantus which have already made waves in the digital realm
			is fundamental to this project. It allows the website to be both accessible as a website and flexible as a
			tool to meet the growing demands of modern scholarship.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Open Source</h5>
		<p>
			This project embraces the idea of collaboration and transparency in the digital realm and builds upon the
			developments of digital academics in the field of manuscript studies. That is why all stages of this project
			were accomplished using largely open source and free to use software. Furthermore, all the code purpose
			written for this project is available to others to use and modify for their own future projects via Github.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>3.3 Stages of Production</h3>
		<p>
			In order to illustrate the process of creating a born-digital manuscript edition, I provided below a roadmap
			for my project. I discuss the methods and guidelines I consulted, and I reflect on the limitations and
			advantages of the various software and platforms I used. For more information on editorial decisions I made
			please see <em>how to read this edition</em>.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Using Transkribus</h5>
		<p>
			Before I could begin to pull my research into a cohesive place, I needed a workable transcription of the
			manuscript. In order to create a digital transcription of the manuscript, I needed a robust tool that could
			serve over 130 high quality images and would preferably be an open access (free to use) tool. Developers at
			the University of Innsbruck, Austria, had developed a tool, <em>Transkribus</em>, that met nearly all my
			specifications. This tool automatically recognizes historical written and printed text and builds an
			intuitive structure around textual elements to make transcription easier. Importantly, it hosts users&rsquo;
			images to the Transkribus server to create &ldquo;private collections&rdquo; that limit access to the
			original user and those they chose to share their collection with. Moreover, the tool allows scholars to
			write in any language using any character set (this project required the extended Latin Unicode alphabet). A
			limitation of Transkribus is the intensive core text necessary before the computer-driven handwriting
			analysis is viable. There was insufficient text in the manuscript to allow me to use this feature.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Working with XML files</h5>
		<p>
			The major caveat of using the Transkribus software was its output format. Transkribus outputs thousands of
			lines of XML code containing a proprietary string format that represents the coordinates of each identified
			element of text (including rubrication, position of lines of text, drop capitals, etc.). The string format
			does not follow XML standards and therefore required a custom parser that detected the location information
			of the various tags (indicating the important textual elements of the document) for it to be correctly
			displayed on the website. However, this transcription when converted to HTML gave many errors and would have
			required manually editing hundreds of lines of code to debug. So, I turned to the TEI output.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Working the TEI</h5>
		<p>
			Transkribus exports in several formats, including TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), PDF, and XML (Extensible
			Markup Language). TEI guidelines, the ideal for many digital humanists, define and shape the XML format to
			be compatible between digital humanities projects.<a href="#_ftn4"
				name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> The payload of this initiative is a vigorous tagging
			system that documents and describes structural and textual elements of virtually any type of document.
			Because the TEI has a large body of documentation on its robust tagging system, another custom parser was
			created to convert the code to HTML in the hope that I would not have to manually debug the code. This
			method indeed proved better than the first, and the parser successfully produced a workable HTML version of
			the transcription for use on the website.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Creating the Website</h5>
		<p>
			In the early stages of this project, I conceptualized the website as being made with a web builder (e.i.
			Wordpress, Wix) to save time and labour. However, several issues arose with these platforms that were
			irreconcilable with my vision for the site. Chiefly, it was key that the website have an interactive
			transcription portion. The exact functionality of it does not come out of the box in any website builders.
			Therefore, the website had to be custom built. I wanted to be able to display the transcription and
			facsimiles side by side in a way that the user can interact with the manuscript in a variety of ways.
			Website builders do not offer this functionality, nor are you able to embed code necessary for it into a
			website builder in both unpaid and paid options. The issue is that website builders do not give the user
			access to its backend, and the interactive transcription demands that large amounts of images be hosted on a
			server connected to the site. Furthermore, website builders come with a lot of extra functionality and
			&ldquo;bulk&rdquo; that can be cumbersome. In the end, having full control of the website was the best way
			to ensure the result I intended.
		</p>
		<p>
			The website was created from scratch using node.js and a vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS front end. Styling for
			the website itself was handled with Bootstrap4. This provided a baseline in which to build the custom
			styling for the website. To properly illustrate the structure and contents (rubrication, hierarchy of
			structure) of the manuscript transcription, corresponding HTML attributes were added to the transcriptions
			to style the various tags (e.i. rubrication, drop-capitals, and so on) with CSS. The hover-over feature that
			expands abbreviations was done using JavaScript. The modal that appears when users access the interactive
			transcription that displays basic usage instructions was added with Bootstrap4.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h5>Heroku</h5>
		<p>
			Heroku is a cloud application platform that allows users to manage their servers for free. The website had to
			be hosted and Heroku provides a server that hosts the site, the images, and the transcriptions. The
			limitations of using the free Heroku service are that the server goes to sleep after thirty minutes of
			inactivity (an approximate 5 sec delay) and there is a limit of 1000 hours available per month. However,
			since only one app is running, this makes no difference as the website can be run continuously. Heroku is
			also well documented and has a large community for support resources that can help newcomers to the tool and
			developers to use the platform and troubleshoot problems as they arise.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>3.4 Conclusions</h3>
		<p>
			Digital projects are more of a process than a final product, and as such are constantly evolving. What I have
			done provides the foundations for further research and further questions. Chief among these are, where to go
			from here?
		</p>
		<p>Ideally, the next steps for this project would be to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Crowdsource the musical notation for this codex. Having no musical experience, I made the decision not
				to attempt a transcription of the musical notation found in this chant manuscript. A logical next step
				for this project would therefore be a transcription of the manuscript&rsquo;s plainchant notation and
				subsequent integration into the Cantus database.</li>
			<li>Integrate manuscript (including musical notation) into the Cantus database.</li>
		</ul>

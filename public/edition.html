			<h3>How to read this edition</h3>
			<p>
				This transcription of the manuscript&rsquo;s text is a visual reproduction, and a diplomatic edition. In
				this
				digital edition, I have placed the images of each folium (manuscript page) on the left hand side. On the right
				side,
				I offer a transcription which does not regularize or modernize the Latin, but rather retains scribal
				mistakes, abbreviated characters, and punctuation as it exists in the manuscript. Given the unique
				nature of
				liturgical manuscripts, I did not seek to establish a comparative critical edition&mdash;i.e. The
				product of
				studying multiple manuscripts to construct a final version with the cumulative information from each
				codex.
				Rather, my edition, as it lives in the digital realm, seeks to let the user guide their interaction with
				the
				text. They can consult the original manuscript (in digitized images), they can consult a direct
				transcription of the text alongside the images, they can also read the alternate text with abbreviations
				unpacked and punctuation regularized. Given the potential for non-linear usage, I consider my edition a
				hypertext edition, because the linked presentation of information achieves through the digital format
				something unlike traditional print texts.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Privileging transcription over critical edition</h5>
			<p>
				The benefit of a transcription over a polished edition is that researchers can easily study the
				palaeographical and codicological aspects of this manuscript through the non-linear use I have described
				above. This decision was made because Carleton Antiphonary, like most liturgical manuscripts, is unique
				in
				its physical composition not only by the nature of handmade work but also because so many liturgical
				manuscripts were distinct products of their time, location, and monastic tradition. The decision to make
				the
				transcription and edition digital was in large part a question of access, especially because Carleton
				University, as a Canadian institution, must rely heavily on digital content for the study of European
				manuscripts.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Digital Format</h5>
			<p>
				Because of the digital format, the text can be shown in numerous ways without compromising user
				experience,
				i.e. the reader does not need to constantly refer to the index and appendices at the back of a paper
				copy to
				make sense of the text. As you will see, in order to unpack an abbreviation or Unicode symbol as presented in
				the
				manuscript in the transcription, the user must simply hover over the word or symbol to have it unpacked
				(with the exception of common usage symbols, as listed in table 7, below).
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Abbreviations</h5>
			<p>
				The table below outlines the abbreviations used throughout the Carleton Antiphonary and explains which
				Unicode symbols were used to mimic the manuscript&rsquo;s forms. The expansion or modern equivalent are
				also
				given, with multiple possible expansions where applicable. The rightmost column displays whether the
				abbreviations have been unpacked in the hypertext edition. Note that symbols that replace single
				letterforms
				(e.g. ꝛ, ꝺ, and Ꝫ) are not unpacked in this transcription but abbreviations with two or more letters are
				unpacked to maintain clarity for the researcher while using this tool.

			<h5>Image files</h5>
			<p>
				The images found on the website were originally produced in TIFF, which were far too large
				(approximately 5
				-
				6 Mi each) even for modern web standards. From a web-friendly point of view, the images had to be
				cropped
				and resized to allow for quick load times on the website. Although the TIFF files would have provided
				extremely clear images for the scrutiny of minute details of the manuscript that in-depth manuscript
				study
				often demands, this decision came from a user experience (UX) stand-point to ensure compatibility with
				the
				widest range of browsers. That being said, the images are still high-quality (362 KB, 685 x 923) and
				useful
				for study. Furthermore, they are available for download so scholars may quickly and frequently access
				them.
			</p>
			<p>
				These images were taken with a digital
				camera, (Canon EOS REBEL T5i) with less than ideal lighting, but in future we hope to produce scans of
				the
				manuscript. Unfortunately, we did not have access to a large enough scanner at the time of this project.
				This presented unique challenges because the orientation, lighting, and dimensions of each image were
				distinct. In other words, each of the 148 original images would have to be manually manipulated.
				Therefore,
				the batch image processor IrfanView, a freeware (proprietary but free to use) software for Windows
				users,
				was used to resize the images to a standard size. This allowed the website to display the folios in a
				streamline and consistent fashion, giving the reader a book-like experience despite the vastly different
				sizes and orientation of the original images. As you will see, the result is not perfect, but provides a
				far
				more attractive product in the final version.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>3.2 Web Edition vs Paper Version</h3>
			<p>
				When I was first introduced to the Carleton Antiphonary in 2016 Carleton University&rsquo;s Archives and
				Research Collections had not yet digitally catalogued any of their medieval materials, nor do they exist
				in
				the library's catalogue. For researchers, it was as if the manuscript did not exist. This project sought
				to
				address this problem by creating an online edition for the codex, circumventing the issues with access
				intrinsic to the printed edition. The main issue that was apparent to me was access to the edition. It
				could
				be written in printed or PDF format and lay hidden in a university&rsquo;s catalogue, where researchers
				from
				both Carleton and elsewhere may never know of its existence, closing the initial circle that I sought to
				address. But a digital project, connected to a popular public database such as the 
				<a href="http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/">Cantus Database</a>,
				would
				have more visibility and would contribute to the mission of bringing this manuscript to light.<sup> <a
						href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></sup>
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Broader Access</h5>
			<p>
				Some of the fundamental access issues are that the commentary and glossary are usually separate from the
				transcription, segregated to the end of the paperback, often rendering it cumbersome for reference.
				Furthermore, a printed work must be produced, published, and distributed before it is accessible to
				scholars. Electronic editions, however, change this process &ndash; making editions not a product but a
				process that can be published online while in progress to allow other scholars to make use of the work
				and
				evem to contribute to it. In essence, once the work is online and accessible (usually through an
				institution) it is catalogued and therefore referenceable, unlike projects which are left to languish
				gathering dust within the shelves upon shelves of uncatalogued theses.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scholars of medieval liturgy and codicology can know of the manuscript&rsquo;s existence and perhaps
				reveal
				some of its long-held secrets through this diplomatic edition. Found on this bespoke website created
				with
				the purpose of showcasing this manuscript in ways suited to its study as both object and text.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Cantus Index</h5>
			<p>
				Cantus is a manuscript database used to reference medieval and early modern Latin ecclesiastical
				sources.
				The
				resource was created by the University of Waterloo and is managed collaboratively by Debra Lacoste
				(University of Waterloo) and Jan Kol&aacute;ček (Charles University, Prague). It has nine major
				databases
				connected to it from across the globe and over 150 sources. Each source is indexed according to its
				chants
				and connected with any concordant chants from other sources. Each chant has a unique Cantus ID number
				that
				is used to reference the list of chants in the Cantus Index, a catalogue for the Cantus Database. In the
				Manuscript Reading (Ms spelling) transcription I have identified each segment of the manuscript by the
				appropriate Cantus ID (see Appendices).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>
				This
				allows researchers to quickly analyse the various parts of the manuscript and find contextual data for
				that
				particular segment. Cantus provides details such as associated feast days, genre, position in office or
				mass, and a list of the concordances for each chant. Users may further research by perusing the hundreds
				of
				manuscript holdings digitally uploaded by institutions onto Cantus Database through the identifiers.
				Interconnectivity with scholarly platforms such as Cantus which have already made waves in the digital
				realm
				is fundamental to this project. It allows the website to be both accessible as a website and flexible as
				a
				tool to meet the growing demands of modern scholarship.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Open Source</h5>
			<p>
				This project embraces the idea of collaboration and transparency in the digital realm and builds upon
				the
				developments of digital academics in the field of manuscript studies. That is why all stages of this
				project
				were accomplished using largely open source and free to use software. Furthermore, all the code purpose
				written for this project is available to others to use and modify for their own future projects via.

			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>3.3 Stages of Production</h3>
			<p>
				In order to illustrate the process of creating a born-digital manuscript edition, I provided below a
				roadmap
				for my project. I discuss the methods and guidelines I consulted, and I reflect on the limitations and
				advantages of the various software and platforms I used. For more information on editorial decisions I
				made
				please see <em>how to read this edition</em>.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Using Transkribus</h5>
			<p>
				Before I could begin to pull my research into a cohesive place, I needed a workable transcription of the
				manuscript. In order to create a digital transcription of the manuscript, I needed a robust tool that
				could
				serve over 130 high quality images and would preferably be an open access (free to use) tool. Developers
				at
				the University of Innsbruck, Austria, had developed a tool, <em>Transkribus</em>, that met nearly all my
				specifications. This tool automatically recognizes historical written and printed text and builds an
				intuitive structure around textual elements to make transcription easier. Importantly, it hosts
				users&rsquo;
				images to the Transkribus server to create &ldquo;private collections&rdquo; that limit access to the
				original user and those they chose to share their collection with. Moreover, the tool allows scholars to
				write in any language using any character set (this project required the extended Latin Unicode
				alphabet). A
				limitation of Transkribus is the intensive core text necessary before the computer-driven handwriting
				analysis is viable. There was insufficient text in the manuscript to allow me to use this feature.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Working with XML files</h5>
			<p>
				The major caveat of using the Transkribus software was its output format. Transkribus outputs thousands
				of
				lines of XML code containing a proprietary string format that represents the coordinates of each
				identified
				element of text (including rubrication, position of lines of text, drop capitals, etc.). The string
				format
				does not follow XML standards and therefore required a custom parser that detected the location
				information
				of the various tags (indicating the important textual elements of the document) for it to be correctly
				displayed on the website. However, this transcription when converted to HTML gave many errors and would
				have
				required manually editing hundreds of lines of code to debug. So, I turned to the TEI output.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Working the TEI</h5>
			<p>
				Transkribus exports in several formats, including TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), PDF, and XML
				(Extensible
				Markup Language). TEI guidelines, the ideal for many digital humanists, define and shape the XML format
				to
				be compatible between digital humanities projects.<a href="#_ftn4"
					name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> The payload of this initiative is a vigorous tagging
				system that documents and describes structural and textual elements of virtually any type of document.
				Because the TEI has a large body of documentation on its robust tagging system, another custom parser
				was
				written by developer <a href="https://github.com/ryanlacroix">Ryan Lacroix</a> to convert the code to HTML in the hope that I would not have to manually debug the code. This
				method indeed proved better than the first, and the parser successfully produced a workable HTML version
				of
				the transcription for use on the website.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Creating the Website</h5>
			<p>
				In the early stages of this project, I conceptualized the website as being made with a web builder (e.i.
				Wordpress, Wix) to save time and labour. However, several issues arose with these platforms that were
				irreconcilable with my vision for the site. Chiefly, it was key that the website have an interactive
				transcription portion. The exact functionality of it does not come out of the box in any website
				builders.
				Therefore, the website had to be custom built. I wanted to be able to display the transcription and
				facsimiles side by side in a way that the user can interact with the manuscript in a variety of ways.
				Website builders do not offer this functionality, nor are you able to embed code necessary for it into a
				website builder in both unpaid and paid options. The issue is that website builders do not give the user
				access to its backend, and the interactive transcription demands that large amounts of images be hosted
				on a
				server connected to the site. Furthermore, website builders come with a lot of extra functionality and
				&ldquo;bulk&rdquo; that can be cumbersome. In the end, having full control of the website was the best
				way
				to ensure the result I intended.
			</p>
			<p>
				The website was created collaboratively (Lacroix, Brasseur) from scratch using node.js and a vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS front end.
				Styling
				for
				the website itself was handled with Bootstrap4. This provided a baseline in which to build the custom
				styling for the website. To properly illustrate the structure and contents (rubrication, hierarchy of
				structure) of the manuscript transcription, corresponding HTML attributes were added to the
				transcriptions
				to style the various tags (e.i. rubrication, drop-capitals, and so on) with CSS. The hover-over feature
				that
				expands abbreviations was done using JavaScript. The modal that appears when users access the
				interactive
				transcription that displays basic usage instructions was added with Bootstrap4.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Heroku</h5>
			<p>
				Heroku is a cloud application platform that allows users to manage their servers for free. The website
				had
				to
				be hosted and Heroku provides a server that hosts the site, the images, and the transcriptions. The
				limitations of using the free Heroku service are that the server goes to sleep after thirty minutes of
				inactivity (an approximate 5 sec delay upon startup) and there is a limit of 1000 hours available per month. However,
				since only one app is running, this makes little difference as the website can be run continuously. Heroku
				is
				also well documented and has a large community for support resources that can help newcomers to the tool
				and
				developers to use the platform and troubleshoot problems as they arise.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h5>Licensing</h5>
			<p>
				I chose to license the website and tool under the Attribution-NonCommercial CC BY-ND license so that the
				website may be used and built upon by anyone if the usage is non-commercial. I chose this because the
				guiding principle of this project and tool has been to be openly accessible to all users. This license
				also permits derivatives of this work to be licensed on different terms if the modifier so chooses.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>3.4 Conclusions</h3>
			<hr />
			<br />
			<p>
				Digital projects are more of a process than a final product, and as such are constantly evolving. What I
				have
				done provides the foundations for further research and further questions. Chief among these are, where
				to go
				from here?
			</p>
			<p>Ideally, the next steps for this project would be to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Crowdsource the musical notation for this codex. Having no musical experience, I made the decision
					not
					to attempt a transcription of the musical notation found in this chant manuscript. A logical next
					step
					for this project would therefore be a transcription of the manuscript&rsquo;s plainchant notation
					and
					subsequent integration into the Cantus database.</li>
				<li>Integrate manuscript (including musical notation) into the Cantus database.</li>
			</ul>

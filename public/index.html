      <h1>Welcome to the Carleton Antiphonary!</h1>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>
        This digital edition of <em>Ottawa, Carleton University Library, Archives and Research Collection MS. 1</em> (identified
        here as
        the Carleton Antiphonary) is presented here in three parts:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A transcription of the manuscript’s text with adjacent images of each folium,</li>
        <li>A codicological analysis of the manuscript focusing on its physical composition and palaeography,</li>
        <li>and an analysis of the manuscript’s contents.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>These are meant as a research aid with the goal of making Carleton’s oldest manuscript available for further study.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although this project in many ways follows the traditional standard of manuscript editions, it was born digital
        to
        address the problems that come with the printed edition: chiefly, access issues and the limitations to
        presentation of information. I discuss these challenges and particularities that come with digital projects in the
        <a href="edition.html">Edition.</a> section.
        To follow the process I took to undertake this project, and the decisions that were made along the way,
        including
        apps
        used, find the project roadmap in the final two sections of Edition (3.2 Web Edition vs Paper Edition and 3.3 Stages of Production).
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also find the code for this website, and the xml files produced for the transcription, as well as the
        code
        parser
        for the Transkribus files on my <a href="https://github.com/kateBrasseur/medieval-folio-site">Github.</a>

      <h3 class="my-3">About This Project</h3>

      <p>
          This website examines <em>Ottawa, Carleton University Library, Archives and Research Collections Ms. 1</em>
          (the Carleton Antiphonary) as a medieval artefact. Lack of resources devoted to
          cataloguing has left many North American manuscripts hidden and unstudied, and such was the fate of the Carleton
          Antiphonary. This project digitizes and analyses this unique compound manuscript to increase the accessibility
          of its digital facsimiles. For this reason, this project is not a critical edition. Furthermore, the codicological
          evidence proves this artefact is worth studying as a devotional object, as it demonstrates long-standing use
          over the last five hundred years.
      </p>
      <p>
          The goal of this project has been twofold. First, it has been to bring this medieval codex to light by making it
          accessible online. Secondly, the goal has been to share the process by which others may make medieval materials
          accessible using open-source tools and the coding purpose made for this project.
      </p>
      <p>This project is a Master's thesis completed in June 2020 by Kate Brasseur.
